            <p>Nestled just a few blocks away from Fraternity Row at the University of Maryland is the center of
                Jewish life. But it’s missing one very important building and it has been for a very long time.
            </p>
            <p><a href="http://www.umdchabad.org/friday-nights/" target="_blank"
                >UMD Chabad House</a>
                on Yale Avenue, hosts Friday night dinners and other Jewish programming throughout
                the school year. The
                <a href="http://meormd.org/team/" target="_blank">UMD MEOR Maryland</a>
                building also offers Jewish programs and learning opportunities.
                The Hillel Building, where
                <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/10/21/umd-new-hillel-college-park-construction-delay/" target="_blank" >thousands of students</a> spend time every week, used to be there. Right now it’s
                located on South Campus, near Prince Frederick Hall dorm and the South Campus Commons apartment buildings.

                <p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The new building is going to sit on the ground of the <a href="https://washingtonjewishweek.com/59107/maryland-hillel-new-building-2022/news/local-news/" target="_blank"
                    >original Hillel</a>,
                    which was right in the center of Jewish life at 7505 Yale Ave. years ago.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The location of the current Hillel building, which is on south campus, is already an issue for north
                campus students, which mostly consists of freshmen and sophomores.
                Moving Hillel to the new location twenty minutes further from north campus will make it
                even harder for these underclassmen to attend services and other events. Students from
                north campus would be able to take the bus more easily to the new location but most of those buses
                only run in the evenings. Many people are on the
            <p><a href="https://marylandhillel.org/kosher-dining/mealplan/" target="_blank"
                >Kosher meal plan</a> at Hillel which makes the simple task
                of getting to breakfast a difficult one.

                <p>“The location is terrible,” UMD student Sam Miller says of the plans for the new building.</p>
                <p>However, Elan Burman who is Hillel’s point of contact for the new building plan,
                    thinks the new building will bring in more students.
                </p>
                <p>He says, “We anticipate that the new location, and custom-built space, will attract
                    a far larger and more diverse community. Being located right near the fraternities and
                    sororities, with whom Hillel works very closely, will allow us to serve as a destination
                    for these students in even greater ways.”
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The new Hillel building will have several expansions such as
                <a href="https://marylandhillelcampaign.org/#renderings" target="_blank">four new multipurpose rooms.</a>
                The current Hillel Building only contains multipurpose rooms for two out of the three denominations.
                Reform (one denomination of Judaism) services are held in a conference room while the other two denominations
                (Conservative and Orthodox) are in multipurpose style room.
            </p>
            <p>The new building will also contain a <a href="https://marylandhillelcampaign.org/#floorplans" target="_blank">Counseling and Wellness Room</a> where students
                can speak privately with staff members who have been trained in pastoral counseling.
                This could be an important resource for the Jewish population which makes up
                <a href="https://www.hillel.org/college-guide/list/record/university-of-maryland--college-park" target="_blank"
                    > almost a fifth</a>
                of UMD students, particularly on a campus where wait times for appointments at
                the counseling center <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/college-park/student-banned-from-umd-dorm-after-seeking-mental-health-treatment/65-547752530" target="_blank"> can be up to a month.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Many
                <a href="https://marylandhillelcampaign.org/#floorplans" target="_blank"
                    >additional rooms</a> not in the current building will be a part of this new building
                including a cafe, a rehearsal space, a lounge/game room and more. However, actually breaking
                ground on construction of the building has been postponed many times from 2019 to
            <p>Many <a href="https://washingtonjewishweek.com/59107/maryland-hillel-new-building-2022/news/local-news/" target="_blank"
                >fall 2021</a>,
                and coronavirus has made the starting date for the construction of the new Hillel
                building less certain.
            </p>
            <p>For some students, the only certainty seems to be how very far away this new building is.
                “They will find a cure to coronavirus before they start building the new building,” says UMD student
                Aaron Krieman. “The idea of a bigger building may help Hillel expand their capabilities, but
                for years us students have heard a lot but things have happened so slowly
                regarding the new building. The new building is more of a running joke to most
                students involved in the Jewish community.”
            </p>
            <p>One of the main reasons the construction of the new building is being held up is for
                <a href="https://dbknews.com/2019/10/21/umd-new-hillel-college-park-construction-delay/" target="_blank"
                    >financial reasons.</a>
                Maryland Hillel is trying to raise most of the money beforehand to avoid massive debt.
                They <a href="https://marylandhillelcampaign.org/" target="_blank"
                    >have raised</a> $11,700 and have extended their deadline to reach $20,000 from March 31, 2020 to April 1, 2021.
            </p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Besides accepting traditional donations, Hillel is also offering a number of
                <a href="https://marylandhillelcampaign.org/#naming" target="_blank"
                    >paid naming opportunities</a>
                on their website. For the lowest tier of donations, $5-7k,
                one could name for example, staff kitchen equipment after himself. For the highest
                tier of donations, $5-8 million, one could name the Hillel Foundation after himself.
            </p>
            <p>With almost everyone off campus due to the virus, it's entirely unclear what will happen next with the plans
                for the new Hillel building.
